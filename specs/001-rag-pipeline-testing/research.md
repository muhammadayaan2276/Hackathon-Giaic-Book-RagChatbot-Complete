# Research: RAG Retrieval & Pipeline Testing

**Date**: 2025-12-27

### Summary of Findings

Based on the provided feature specification, the technical context (Python, Cohere for embeddings, Qdrant Cloud for vector database), and the established usage within the project's ingestion pipeline, no further specific research is deemed necessary for the initial implementation of the RAG retrieval test script.

The core technologies are well-defined, and their integration patterns are consistent with the existing codebase. The focus of this phase will be on implementing the retrieval logic and validation rather than exploring alternative technologies or fundamental research questions.

### Alternatives Considered

*   No new alternatives were considered as the technology stack (Cohere, Qdrant) is mandated by the project constraints and existing ingestion pipeline.
