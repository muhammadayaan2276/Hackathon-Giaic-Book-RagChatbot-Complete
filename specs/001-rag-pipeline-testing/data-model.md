# Data Model: RAG Retrieval & Pipeline Testing

**Date**: 2025-12-27

This document describes the key data entities involved in the RAG Retrieval & Pipeline Testing feature.

## Entities

### 1. Query

Represents the input text provided by the user for which relevant content needs to be retrieved.

*   **Attributes**:
    *   `text`: `string`
        *   **Description**: The natural language input from the user.
        *   **Validation**: Non-empty string.

### 2. Chunk

Represents a segment of text extracted from the Docusaurus book documentation. These chunks are stored in Qdrant along with their corresponding vector embeddings and metadata.

*   **Attributes**:
    *   `id`: `string` (UUID)
        *   **Description**: A unique identifier for the chunk, corresponding to the Qdrant point ID. Generated during ingestion.
    *   `text`: `string`
        *   **Description**: The textual content of the chunk itself.
    *   `embedding`: `list of floats`
        *   **Description**: The vector representation of the `text` generated by the Cohere embedding model. (Note: While conceptually part of the chunk, this is stored separately in Qdrant's vector field, not typically in the payload).
    *   `url`: `string`
        *   **Description**: The URL of the Docusaurus page from which the chunk was extracted.
    *   `title`: `string`
        *   **Description**: The title of the source Docusaurus page or document.
    *   `section`: `string` (Optional)
        *   **Description**: A high-level section or heading within the source document from which the chunk originated.
    *   `chunk_index`: `integer`
        *   **Description**: The sequential index of the chunk within its original document or source page, indicating its order.

## Relationships

*   **Query to Chunk**: During retrieval, a `Query` is used to find one or more `Chunk` entities that are semantically similar to it. This is a many-to-many relationship in terms of potential matches, but for a single retrieval operation, one `Query` results in a list of `Chunk` objects.
